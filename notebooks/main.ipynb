In our spiral example, an MLP sees only individual points $(x_{0}, x_{1})$ and never “knows” how they connect into spirals. If you rotate or warp points arbitrarily, you'll send some points from spiral A into regions that really belong to spiral B—so the model gets conflicting examples (same transformed coordinates, different labels), which actually hurts learning rather than helps.\n",
